    <h1>CSH Explanations</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>
        CSH 1: Explain the benefits of using new and existing features
    </h2>
    <h4>As opposed to an average browser, this image searcher can display only the requested amount of images. This helps to limit
    the amount of data collected to only what the user desires.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>CSH 2: Explain the costs of using new and existing features</h2>
    <h4> Since the image searcher displays the exact amount of images requested, there is an extra field for the user to fill out
    in order to make an image request. Slight time added.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>
        CSH 3:  Let people gather as much information as they
        want, and no more than they want
    </h2>
    <h4>The user can request exactly the number of images they want. If they want 1 image, they can request that. If they want 20,
    they can do that as well.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>CSH 4: Keep familiar features available</h2>
    <h4>Like more popular image searchers, the images that are displayed are the ones that are valuable to the topic at hand. This way,
    the images the user sees are relative to their search.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>CSH 5: Make undo/redo and backtracking available</h2>
    <h4>If a user does not like the results they get for a search, then they can easily make another request for a different query
    or a different number of images.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>CSH 6: Provide an explicit path through the task</h2>
    <h4>There is a clear option to display the images that were requested in the UI for the Image Searcher.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>CSH 7: Provide ways to try out different approaches</h2>
    <h4>A user can make as many requests as they want in order to find the results that they ultimately desire.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>CSH 8: Encourage tinkerers to tinker mindfully</h2>
    <h4>The code is safely written. For example, a number has to be input into the 'number of images' field. This way,
    tinkerers can tinker with the features without fear of breaking anything.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>Quality Attribute: Responsiveness</h2>
    <h4>The image URLs exchanged between the Microservice, written to a file, and read from the UI very quickly. The responsiveness
    to load the images is very fast. When the button is clicked, images appear immediately.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>Additional Features: Multiple Requests</h2>
    <h4>
        DoD: Given the user makes an image request,
        when the request is made, then the user is
        given the option to make more requests and
        eventually as many as they need.
    </h4>
    <h4>The user can make as many requests as they desire as long as the App is running.</h4>
    <br />
    <h2>Additional Features: Display</h2>
    <h4>
        DoD: Given the user makes an image search, when
        the request is finalized, then the images
        searched for are displayed to their screen or
        downloaded into their current directory that
        they are working in.
    </h4>
    <h4>The images are displayed to the user as soon as they click the 'Display Requested Images' button.</h4>
